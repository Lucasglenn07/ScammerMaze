## üìù Usage Guide

### 1. Account Setup
1. Visit `/auth/register` to create an account
2. Verify your email address (check console logs in development)
3. Login at `/auth/login`

### 2. Creating Your First Maze
1. Go to "Create New Maze" from the dashboard
2. Use the drag-and-drop builder to add tasks:
   - **Image Hunt**: Users find objects in images
   - **Form Filling**: Collect personal information
   - **Math Problems**: Security verification calculations
   - **Wait Timers**: Forced waiting periods
   - **CAPTCHAs**: Human verification

3. Connect tasks with arrows to create the flow
4. Configure each task's difficulty and parameters
5. Save and publish your maze

### 3. Using Templates
1. Visit `/templates` to see pre-built mazes
2. The "Basic Loop" template includes:
   - Image object finding
   - Personal information form
   - 5 math problems
   - 30-second wait timer
   - CAPTCHA verification
   - Loops back to the beginning

3. Click "Use Template" to create a copy you can customize

### 4. Sharing Scammer Sites
1. Once published, your maze gets a unique URL: `/portal/[slug]`
2. Share this URL with scammers
3. The site appears as "SecureBank Verification Portal"
4. Scammers will be guided through your task maze

### 5. Analytics & Reporting
1. Visit `/analytics` to see detailed reports:
   - Total time wasted across all mazes
   - Session duration and completion rates
   - Geographic distribution of visitors
   - Device type breakdown
   - Trial-by-trial performance metrics
   - Exit rates and abandonment points

2. Export data as CSV for further analysis
3. Filter by date range and specific mazes

## üîß Task Types

## üìà Best Practices

### Effective Maze Design
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with easy tasks to build confidence
2. **Increase Complexity**: Gradually make tasks more difficult
3. **Add Delays**: Use wait timers strategically
4. **Create Loops**: Send users back to previous steps
5. **False Progress**: Show progress bars that reset

### Maximizing Time Waste
1. **Multiple Verification Steps**: Require several forms of verification
2. **Precise Requirements**: Make form fields very specific
3. **Random Failures**: Have CAPTCHAs fail occasionally
4. **Processing Delays**: Add artificial wait times
5. **Endless Loops**: Never actually complete the process
